Game Title: Definitely NOT a Punch Out Clone

Inspiration: Punch Out!!

Creative Twist: It’s gonna be way easier because I am NOT coding all that in a week. Also maybe do it with robots or something. Like Real Steel

Core Gameplay Loop:
Punch the opponent and dodge their punches until either you or the opponent hits the floor

The Challenge:
If you get hit too much you’ll get knocked out and lose

Key Features:
For extra features, I’d like to add multiple opponents, different punches, and maybe dodge directions/ducking/blocking.
